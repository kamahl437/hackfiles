Terminal basics(needed for Raspberry Pi setup) - 
Open a Terminal(if you need help finding, refer to the link at the bottom)
When typeing the below commands in single quotes('') press the enter key after the command.
Type 'ls' and remember to press enter afterwards :)
The listing shows the directories and files in your current folder)
type 'pwd'
This will show you the absolute path of directory you are in, and stands for "present working directory"
type 'mkdir folderName'
This will create a directory called 'folderName'
Cd {the directory} will "change Directory" to the specified directory
In our case type 'cd folderName'
type 'pwd'
what does it say now?
type 'cd ..' To go up a level in the directory tree.  
.. always means one directory above where I am now, while a single . means my current directory
type 'ls' to see the directories again.
Rm -r {directory} will delete a directory.  
In our case type 'rm -r folderName'.  This will delete our folder.
Notice it asked if you were sure before it deleted the folder.  Using rm -rf {folder} will force delete and not ask you, so be careful!

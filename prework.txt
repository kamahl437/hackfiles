Open a Terminal
Type 'ls'
The listings are your directories(the contents of your current folder)
type 'pwd'
Will show you the directory you are in(present working directory)
'mkdir folderName'
This will create a directory called 'folderName'
Cd {the directory} will "change Directory" to the specified directory
In our case 'cd folderName'
type 'pwd'
what does it say now?
Cd .. To go 'up' a level in the directory tree
Ls to see the directories again
Rm -r {directory} to delete a directory
In our case rm -r folderName
